# CS 1.3 Assignments!
I know I'm not in this class but I literally did everything for CS 1.2 already. I helped my friend with an assignment for this class and it looked fun. So I'm just gonna do all the work in a desperate attempt to skip CS 1.3 next term so I'm not one class behind. :') pls. I'll even take the quizzes if I get the chance to. :')
